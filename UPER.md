<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* 
* 1. I have been tasked with building a small app that calculates tax on a list of items and using the TDD method.
* 2. I need to build the tests first and test all possible applications of the program. 
* 3. I need to consider what would need to be tested in order to fully test the application. 
* 4. Decide what outputs need to be shown in order to be successful.
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*
* ReadMe shows sales tax added into the output prices, and also totaled at the bottom, so must gear application in that direction.
* Review the OOP, OOD and TDD notes from courses/class and build design.
* What can be separated into its own class - printing, imported versus domestic? Exempt vs non-exempt? 
* Interface for sales tax? 
* Plan tests to capture all functionality 
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*
* I built the basic plan in the main class and then refactored to try and separate concerns.
* I created more tests as I coded, trying to test the basic input output, pricing and tax calculations. 
* I attempted to refactor this even more to get rid of the array, but could not figure out how to calculate the price a different way. 
* I kept working at it and finally got it refactored to be a little more OOP oriented, though I am sure it's not perfect. 
*
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*
*I enjoyed this assignment as it was enjoyable to have the outcome work. TDD is a fun
development method and I an see how useful it would be on larger and larger
applications. 
I was able to do some refactoring to make the project more OOP friendly.
